/*
For spacing, use the 8px major scale grid.

For heights, widths, margins, paddings use values that are always divisible by 8.
We call this the major scale.

major-scale(1) => 8px
major-scale(2) => 16px
major-scale(3) => 24px
major-scale(4) => 32px
major-scale(5) => 40px
*/

/*
Use the 4px minor scale grid for values under 40px

Only use the 4px grid for values under 40.
Try making your designs work with the major scale first before using the minor scale.
Use the minor scale primarily for spacing only when the major scale is too much.

For example: 4, 12, 20 are fine to use. But avoid using 52.

minor-scale(1) => 4px
minor-scale(3) => 12px
minor-scale(5) => 20px
minor-scale(7) => 28px
minor-scale(9) => 36px
*/
@function minor-scale($scale) {
  @return ($scale * 4) + px;
}
