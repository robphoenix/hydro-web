# Hydro PoC

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Install

Clone this repo to your local machine and run `npm install` to install all dependencies. This will also install Angular & TypeScript to the local project, so you _shouldn't_ need to have them already installed globally.

## Development server

We're currently using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to mock a REST API. To use this run `npm run server` within the repo, this will start the mock API running on `http://localhost:3000`.

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
